					<li author="DV Gundappa"> Life is a Horse driven cart, Fate its driver. You are the horse, Passengers - as allotted by God. Sometimes rides to a wedding, sometimes to the graveyard. On stumbling, there is always the earth.  </li>

					<li author="Srinivasa Ramanujan"> An equation means nothing to me unless it expresses a thought of God.  </li>	

					<li author="Patanjali">  Undisturbed calmness of mind is attained by cultivating friendliness toward the happy, compassion for the unhappy, delight in the virtuous, and indifference toward the wicked. </li>
